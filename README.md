## breast_cancer.ipynb
In this notebook, we aimed to detect breast cancer using the bc = load_breast_cancer() dataset. We performed the following steps: Preprocessing and Classification. We utilized the following machine-learning algorithms:
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
In the comparison section, we observed that the ANN algorithm performed better compared to the others.

## number_recognition.ipynb
For number recognition from images using the load_digits() dataset, we conducted Preprocessing and Classification. The machine learning algorithms used were:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
In the comparison, the SVM algorithm exhibited superior performance compared to the others.

## PCA_number_recognition.ipynb 
In this notebook, we explored dimensionality reduction to enhance number recognition from images using the load_digits() dataset. We started with Preprocessing, applied PCA for dimensionality reduction, and performed Classification. The machine learning algorithms used were:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
Reducing the feature count from 64 to 32 in the dimensionality reduction section didn't significantly impact the algorithms' performance, but it notably improved computational speed.
